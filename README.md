# Reactjs-Insafeed

Reactjs-Instafeed is an in-progress/plug and play Reactjs component for a personal Instagram feed. After setting up a personal Instagram App, and Authorizing a feed(s), this component can be added to a project to display an Instagram feed directly from the Instagram API

## Additional Notes

This repo is under development and I plan to add instructions on Creating an instagram app, walking through the steps to authorize an account, as well as adding the files that are currently not present.
